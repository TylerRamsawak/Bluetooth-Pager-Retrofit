## 10/27/2025 - Finding Suitable BLE SoC and Power Solution  

I searched for a supplier and settled on Nordic because of plenty of documentation and libraries. From there, I searched for a module, since FCC approval is too costly and time consuming. Otherwise, i totally wouldve made it myself to have better flexibility in the case of the pager.
Added nRF symbol and am beginning to think about which dc/dc converter to use, peripherals like buzzer, headphone jack, buttons, and LCD driver, and writing the sidekick IOS app.
I am most likely going to go with a step up from MPS, since Ive used mps in the past. I am worried about battery life. A single alk. AA can provide 2500mAh and a constant RX from the soc is 13.5mA. (2500/13.5)/24 = 7.72 days ignoring other factors.
Anyways, much to show for right now.

## 10/28/2025 - Researching Power and Selecting a New BLE Module  

I've done plenty of research and have settled on the nPM2100 pmic from Nordic. It's got features up the wazoo like an i2c fuel gauge, ultra low power, ship mode, and its super tiny. It looks to be more efficient for radio as compared to the MPS pmic.
Now I need to start thinking about what pager I will use. There are three main types I want to consider: The upright numberic pagers, the elite size pagers, and the micro size pagers. The numeric pagers will be easiest to interface the display or I can replace it with a .91" OLED. The elite pager's display will be difficult to interface but can be replaced with a 16x2 LCD. The micro pager's display can be trivially interfaced and can also be replaced with an i2c OLED. Until I get an actual unit off ebay, I wont think too much about the display technology right now.
I am changing the BLE module. Adafruit is too expensive at $7 and Raytac documentation sux. Im going with the ublox BMD-330-A-R. its only $3.98 and uses bt v 5.0 instead of 4(?) i think the old raytac module was using.
I looked into the discharge curve of the duracell AA coppertop battery. Looks promising, I can get about 150 hours at 25mA, so almost 7 days. Since the ublox chip min input is 1.7V, we will use that pmic from nordic.
Nothing much to show, mainly research.
