## 10/27/2025 - Finding Suitable BLE SoC and Power Solution  

I searched for a supplier and settled on Nordic because of plenty of documentation and libraries. From there, I searched for a module, since FCC approval is too costly and time consuming. Otherwise, i totally wouldve made it myself to have better flexibility in the case of the pager.
Added nRF symbol and am beginning to think about which dc/dc converter to use, peripherals like buzzer, headphone jack, buttons, and LCD driver, and writing the sidekick IOS app.
I am most likely going to go with a step up from MPS, since Ive used mps in the past. I am worried about battery life. A single alk. AA can provide 2500mAh and a constant RX from the soc is 13.5mA. (2500/13.5)/24 = 7.72 days ignoring other factors.
Anyways, much to show for right now.
